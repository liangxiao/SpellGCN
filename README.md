This is the official code for paper titled "SpellGCN: Incorporating Phonological and Visual Similarities into Chinese Spelling Check". Accepted by ACL2020

## How to run?

The code is based on Tensorflow==1.13.1 and python 2.7 or higher

To replicate the results from the paper, run commands as follows:

```
cd scripts/
conda create -n spellgcn python=2.7.1
source activate spellgcn
pip install tensorflow==1.13.1
sh run.sh
```

Note: Since SpellGCN is based on BERT, the path to the BERT directory should be provided in the run.sh.
The default training data is the combination of data samples from SIGHAN13, SIGHAN14, SIGHAN15.
